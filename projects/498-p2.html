<br>
Project completed with <a href="https://sites.google.com/umich.edu/hanzhibianportfolio/introduction-and-bio">Iris Bian</a>

Technologies used: The program was developed in Unity. We focused on creating reusable scripts that enabled shared and efficient code between many class objects as well as flexibility to create multiple environments. We utilized Mixamo, Sketchfab, and Soundcloud to find the project assets (see <a href="resources/498-P2-credits.txt">credits.txt</a> for more details). We utilized Jira Boards to foster an Agile development environment and utilized Gitlab as our code-sharing repository. Video output was captured by Windows screen record and the program was run on the Unity editor and an iPhone.
